## Progress and Findings:

Today, I spent a significant amount of time debugging my data cleaning script to ensure I wouldn't lose any valuable data or retain any bad data. I created a script that selects 100 random images from the dataset I compiled from cars.com. Based on my defined parameters, the script then sorts the images into either a "cleaned" folder or a "discarded" folder.

After running the script, I manually reviewed the images in both folders to identify any that were incorrectly classified. This process allowed me to fine-tune my parameters multiple times. During these iterations, I also discovered a logic error in my script. By addressing this error and updating my parameters, I was able to improve the accuracy of my data cleaning process.
